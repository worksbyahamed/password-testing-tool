# Wordlists for Educational Password Testing

This directory contains wordlists for educational password testing purposes.

## Available Wordlists

### common_passwords.txt
Contains the top ~150 most commonly used passwords based on public breach data. This is a minimal list for educational purposes only.

### default_creds.txt
Contains common default username:password combinations found in various systems and applications.

## Educational Purpose

These wordlists are provided for educational purposes only to demonstrate:

1. Why common passwords are insecure
2. The importance of changing default credentials
3. How easily guessable many passwords are

## Creating Custom Wordlists

For educational testing, you can create your own custom wordlists based on specific themes or patterns:

```bash
# Example of creating a small themed wordlist
echo -e "spring2025\nsummer2025\nfall2025\nwinter2025" > seasonal_passwords.txt
```

## Ethical Usage

Remember that these wordlists should only be used against systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized password testing is illegal and unethical.
